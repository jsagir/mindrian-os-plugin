# Roadmap: Obsidian Vault Export v1.9.8

## Overview

Four-phase build that turns any Data Room into a fully-branded Obsidian vault. First the wikilink engine and branded footers (the core Node.js CJS transformation scripts proven on align-ecosystem and hebrew-university-yissum), then the Obsidian kit and welcome doc (static CSS/JSON assets plus markdown generation), then the user-facing /mos:vault command that orchestrates everything into a one-command export, and finally native wikilink injection at filing time so future artifacts arrive pre-linked.

## Phase Details

### Phase 76: Wikilink Engine + Branded Footers
**Goal**: Any room's markdown files can be transformed with cross-linked wikilinks and branded footers via standalone Node.js CJS scripts
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase -- scripts operate on any room folder)
**Requirements**: WIKI-01, WIKI-02, WIKI-03, WIKI-04, WIKI-05, WIKI-06, WIKI-07, BRAND-01, BRAND-02, BRAND-03, BRAND-04, ARCH-01, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, ARCH-06, RULES-03, RULES-04, RULES-05, RULES-07, RULES-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running the wikilink injector on a room with team profiles converts first-occurrence team member names into [[team/member-name/PROFILE.md|Name]] links across all content files, skipping YAML frontmatter and self-references
  2. Filed-to stub files gain wikilinks to both the target artifact and the source meeting, and meeting summaries gain a "Filed Artifacts" index linking to all filed content
  3. STATE.md and ROOM.md section references become navigable [[section/ROOM.md|name]] wikilinks, and sub-room ROOM.md files gain parent + sibling navigation links
  4. Every content artifact (not system files like ROOM.md, STATE.md, CLAUDE.md) receives a MindrianOS branded footer with section, date, and room path, varying by file type
  5. Both the wikilink injector and footer injector are idempotent -- running twice produces identical output with no duplicate links or footers
  6. Artifact note titles are exported as claim sentences (ARCH-01), frontmatter includes vault-aware properties: related, parent-moc, sources, status (ARCH-04)
  7. Two link types enforced: serendipity links inline (xref, cross-domain) vs structural links in frontmatter/footer (hierarchy) (ARCH-05), with quality filter -- every link explainable in one sentence (ARCH-06)
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 76-01-PLAN.md -- Shared room scanner + wikilink injection engine (WIKI-01 to WIKI-07, ARCH-05, ARCH-06)
- [ ] 76-02-PLAN.md -- Frontmatter schema enrichment + branded footer injector (BRAND-01 to BRAND-04, RULES-09, ARCH-04)
- [ ] 76-03-PLAN.md -- Content reformatter: callouts, claim titles, nested folders, terminal cleanup (ARCH-01, RULES-03 to RULES-05, RULES-07)

### Phase 77: Obsidian Kit + Welcome Doc
**Goal**: A complete .obsidian/ configuration preset and a generated Welcome landing page make any room instantly usable in Obsidian with De Stijl branding
**Depends on**: Phase 76 (wikilinks must exist for the Welcome doc to link to them, and CSS must style wikilink-rich content)
**Requirements**: KIT-01, KIT-02, KIT-03, KIT-04, KIT-05, WELCOME-01, WELCOME-02, WELCOME-03, WELCOME-04, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-07, SECTION-01, SECTION-02, SECTION-03, SECTION-04, SECTION-05, SECTION-06, SECTION-07, RULES-01, RULES-02, RULES-06, RULES-08, RULES-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Opening a vault folder in Obsidian shows De Stijl dark theme with Mondrian color-bar headers, gold wikilinks, colored sidebar, Mondrian hr dividers, and styled tables
  2. Obsidian's graph view renders with section-colored nodes (problem=red, business=blue, financial=gold, competitive=cyan, solution=green, team=purple, meetings=gray), hidden orphans, arrows, and tuned force layout
  3. A "Welcome to MindrianOS.md" file serves as the Home Note (tier-0 MOC) linking to section MOCs (tier-1), which link to permanent notes (tier-2) -- following 3-tier hierarchy (ARCH-07)
  4. Section ROOM.md files serve as MOC hubs linking only to entry-point artifacts, not every sub-note (ARCH-02). Welcome doc is the top-level Home Note (ARCH-03)
  5. The Welcome doc adapts to room contents -- sections without relevant data are omitted, and Obsidian callouts provide rich formatting
  6. Every section folder has the trifecta: ROOM.md (identity) + STATE.md (status with artifact count, completeness, gap status, wikilinks to artifacts) + MINTO.md (Minto/MECE reasoning over section artifacts with wikilinks to sources and cross-refs)
  7. Section STATE.md and MINTO.md generated recursively through all nested sub-rooms. MINTO.md skipped for empty sections (nothing to reason over). STATE.md generated even for empty sections (showing gap status)
**Plans**: 4 plans
**UI hint**: yes
Plans:
- [ ] 77-01-PLAN.md -- Static Obsidian kit: De Stijl CSS, graph.json, appearance.json, note templates (KIT-01..05, RULES-08)
- [ ] 77-02-PLAN.md -- Welcome doc generator (WELCOME-01..04, ARCH-03, ARCH-07)
- [ ] 77-03-PLAN.md -- Per-section STATE.md + MINTO.md generators, recursive (SECTION-01..07, ARCH-02)
- [ ] 77-04-PLAN.md -- VAULT-RULES.md design system doc generator (RULES-01, RULES-02, RULES-06, RULES-10)

### Phase 78: /mos:vault Command + /mos:room linkify
**Goal**: Users can export any room as an Obsidian vault with one command, or retroactively inject wikilinks into an existing room in-place
**Depends on**: Phase 77 (vault export orchestrates wikilinks + footers + kit + welcome doc -- all must exist)
**Requirements**: VAULT-01, VAULT-02, VAULT-03, VAULT-04, VAULT-05, VAULT-06, WIKI-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User runs `/mos:vault` and gets a complete Obsidian-ready folder with all wikilinks injected, branded footers applied, .obsidian/ config dropped, and Welcome doc generated
  2. Vault export resolves symlinked sub-rooms into real folder copies (no broken links in Obsidian), skips binary caches (.lazygraph, .context, .mindrian, node_modules, .git), and includes Snapshot view folder
  3. User can specify a target path (`/mos:vault --path ~/Downloads`) or accept sensible default, and can export any room (active, named, or path)
  4. User runs `/mos:room linkify` to retroactively inject wikilinks and footers into the active room in-place (modifying files directly, not exporting)
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 78-01-PLAN.md -- vault-export-orchestrator.cjs master pipeline (VAULT-01..06)
- [ ] 78-02-PLAN.md -- /mos:vault + /mos:room linkify slash commands and CLI routing (WIKI-08)

### Phase 79: Native Filing Wikilinks
**Goal**: New artifacts created through existing filing pathways arrive pre-linked with wikilinks, eliminating the need for retroactive injection
**Depends on**: Phase 76 (wikilink engine functions must exist to be called from filing code)
**Requirements**: NATIVE-01, NATIVE-02, NATIVE-03, NATIVE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a meeting is filed via file-meeting, newly created artifacts (summaries, filed-to stubs, action items) contain wikilinks to team members and section references
  2. Room-passive filing skill adds wikilinks when filing new entries to any room section
  3. Cross-reference generation includes wikilinks to source and target files, and team profile creation includes a wikilinked contribution table
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 80: Vault Import -- Obsidian to Data Room
**Goal**: Any Obsidian vault or folder of Markdown files can be converted into a fully-structured MindrianOS Data Room with one command, immediately usable with all /mos: commands
**Depends on**: Phase 78 (uses the same wikilink engine, footer injector, and room structure generators in reverse)
**Requirements**: IMPORT-01, IMPORT-02, IMPORT-03, IMPORT-04, IMPORT-05, IMPORT-06, IMPORT-07, IMPORT-08, IMPORT-09, IMPORT-10, IMPORT-11, IMPORT-12
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User runs `/mos:vault import --path ~/my-vault` and gets a complete Data Room with classified artifacts in the correct sections, ROOM.md at every level, STATE.md + MINTO.md per section
  2. Content classifier correctly routes notes to room sections based on content analysis (problem keywords -> problem-definition, financial data -> financial-model, etc.) with confidence scores
  3. Person names detected and team/ profiles auto-generated with wikilinked contribution tables. Meeting notes detected by date/attendee patterns and filed to meetings/
  4. Classification report generated showing where each note landed, confidence, and unclassified notes in inbox/ for manual routing
  5. After import, `/mos:status`, `/mos:grade`, `/mos:diagnose` and all other commands work immediately on the imported room
  6. Works on any folder of .md files -- Obsidian-specific features (wikilinks, frontmatter, .obsidian/) are bonuses, not requirements
**Plans**: TBD
