# Roadmap: Obsidian Vault Export v1.9.8

## Overview

Four-phase build that turns any Data Room into a fully-branded Obsidian vault. First the wikilink engine and branded footers (the core Node.js CJS transformation scripts proven on align-ecosystem and hebrew-university-yissum), then the Obsidian kit and welcome doc (static CSS/JSON assets plus markdown generation), then the user-facing /mos:vault command that orchestrates everything into a one-command export, and finally native wikilink injection at filing time so future artifacts arrive pre-linked.

## Phase Details

### Phase 76: Wikilink Engine + Branded Footers
**Goal**: Any room's markdown files can be transformed with cross-linked wikilinks and branded footers via standalone Node.js CJS scripts
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase -- scripts operate on any room folder)
**Requirements**: WIKI-01, WIKI-02, WIKI-03, WIKI-04, WIKI-05, WIKI-06, WIKI-07, BRAND-01, BRAND-02, BRAND-03, BRAND-04, ARCH-01, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, ARCH-06, RULES-03, RULES-04, RULES-05, RULES-07, RULES-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running the wikilink injector on a room with team profiles converts first-occurrence team member names into [[team/member-name/PROFILE.md|Name]] links across all content files, skipping YAML frontmatter and self-references
  2. Filed-to stub files gain wikilinks to both the target artifact and the source meeting, and meeting summaries gain a "Filed Artifacts" index linking to all filed content
  3. STATE.md and ROOM.md section references become navigable [[section/ROOM.md|name]] wikilinks, and sub-room ROOM.md files gain parent + sibling navigation links
  4. Every content artifact (not system files like ROOM.md, STATE.md, CLAUDE.md) receives a MindrianOS branded footer with section, date, and room path, varying by file type
  5. Both the wikilink injector and footer injector are idempotent -- running twice produces identical output with no duplicate links or footers
  6. Artifact note titles are exported as claim sentences (ARCH-01), frontmatter includes vault-aware properties: related, parent-moc, sources, status (ARCH-04)
  7. Two link types enforced: serendipity links inline (xref, cross-domain) vs structural links in frontmatter/footer (hierarchy) (ARCH-05), with quality filter -- every link explainable in one sentence (ARCH-06)
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 76-01-PLAN.md -- Shared room scanner + wikilink injection engine (WIKI-01 to WIKI-07, ARCH-05, ARCH-06)
- [ ] 76-02-PLAN.md -- Frontmatter schema enrichment + branded footer injector (BRAND-01 to BRAND-04, RULES-09, ARCH-04)
- [ ] 76-03-PLAN.md -- Content reformatter: callouts, claim titles, nested folders, terminal cleanup (ARCH-01, RULES-03 to RULES-05, RULES-07)

### Phase 77: Obsidian Kit + Welcome Doc
**Goal**: A complete .obsidian/ configuration preset and a generated Welcome landing page make any room instantly usable in Obsidian with De Stijl branding
**Depends on**: Phase 76 (wikilinks must exist for the Welcome doc to link to them, and CSS must style wikilink-rich content)
**Requirements**: KIT-01, KIT-02, KIT-03, KIT-04, KIT-05, WELCOME-01, WELCOME-02, WELCOME-03, WELCOME-04, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-07, SECTION-01, SECTION-02, SECTION-03, SECTION-04, SECTION-05, SECTION-06, SECTION-07, RULES-01, RULES-02, RULES-06, RULES-08, RULES-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Opening a vault folder in Obsidian shows De Stijl dark theme with Mondrian color-bar headers, gold wikilinks, colored sidebar, Mondrian hr dividers, and styled tables
  2. Obsidian's graph view renders with section-colored nodes (problem=red, business=blue, financial=gold, competitive=cyan, solution=green, team=purple, meetings=gray), hidden orphans, arrows, and tuned force layout
  3. A "Welcome to MindrianOS.md" file serves as the Home Note (tier-0 MOC) linking to section MOCs (tier-1), which link to permanent notes (tier-2) -- following 3-tier hierarchy (ARCH-07)
  4. Section ROOM.md files serve as MOC hubs linking only to entry-point artifacts, not every sub-note (ARCH-02). Welcome doc is the top-level Home Note (ARCH-03)
  5. The Welcome doc adapts to room contents -- sections without relevant data are omitted, and Obsidian callouts provide rich formatting
  6. Every section folder has the trifecta: ROOM.md (identity) + STATE.md (status with artifact count, completeness, gap status, wikilinks to artifacts) + MINTO.md (Minto/MECE reasoning over section artifacts with wikilinks to sources and cross-refs)
  7. Section STATE.md and MINTO.md generated recursively through all nested sub-rooms. MINTO.md skipped for empty sections (nothing to reason over). STATE.md generated even for empty sections (showing gap status)
**Plans**: 4 plans
**UI hint**: yes
Plans:
- [ ] 77-01-PLAN.md -- Static Obsidian kit: De Stijl CSS, graph.json, appearance.json, note templates (KIT-01..05, RULES-08)
- [ ] 77-02-PLAN.md -- Welcome doc generator (WELCOME-01..04, ARCH-03, ARCH-07)
- [ ] 77-03-PLAN.md -- Per-section STATE.md + MINTO.md generators, recursive (SECTION-01..07, ARCH-02)
- [ ] 77-04-PLAN.md -- VAULT-RULES.md design system doc generator (RULES-01, RULES-02, RULES-06, RULES-10)

### Phase 78: /mos:vault Command + /mos:room linkify
**Goal**: Users can export any room as an Obsidian vault with one command, or retroactively inject wikilinks into an existing room in-place
**Depends on**: Phase 77 (vault export orchestrates wikilinks + footers + kit + welcome doc -- all must exist)
**Requirements**: VAULT-01, VAULT-02, VAULT-03, VAULT-04, VAULT-05, VAULT-06, WIKI-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User runs `/mos:vault` and gets a complete Obsidian-ready folder with all wikilinks injected, branded footers applied, .obsidian/ config dropped, and Welcome doc generated
  2. Vault export resolves symlinked sub-rooms into real folder copies (no broken links in Obsidian), skips binary caches (.lazygraph, .context, .mindrian, node_modules, .git), and includes Snapshot view folder
  3. User can specify a target path (`/mos:vault --path ~/Downloads`) or accept sensible default, and can export any room (active, named, or path)
  4. User runs `/mos:room linkify` to retroactively inject wikilinks and footers into the active room in-place (modifying files directly, not exporting)
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 78-01-PLAN.md -- vault-export-orchestrator.cjs master pipeline (VAULT-01..06)
- [ ] 78-02-PLAN.md -- /mos:vault + /mos:room linkify slash commands and CLI routing (WIKI-08)

### Phase 79: Native Filing Wikilinks
**Goal**: New artifacts created through existing filing pathways arrive pre-linked with wikilinks, eliminating the need for retroactive injection
**Depends on**: Phase 76 (wikilink engine functions must exist to be called from filing code)
**Requirements**: NATIVE-01, NATIVE-02, NATIVE-03, NATIVE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a meeting is filed via file-meeting, newly created artifacts (summaries, filed-to stubs, action items) contain wikilinks to team members and section references
  2. Room-passive filing skill adds wikilinks when filing new entries to any room section
  3. Cross-reference generation includes wikilinks to source and target files, and team profile creation includes a wikilinked contribution table
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 80: Vault Import -- Obsidian to Data Room
**Goal**: Any Obsidian vault or folder of Markdown files can be converted into a fully-structured MindrianOS Data Room with one command, immediately usable with all /mos: commands
**Depends on**: Phase 78 (uses the same wikilink engine, footer injector, and room structure generators in reverse)
**Requirements**: IMPORT-01, IMPORT-02, IMPORT-03, IMPORT-04, IMPORT-05, IMPORT-06, IMPORT-07, IMPORT-08, IMPORT-09, IMPORT-10, IMPORT-11, IMPORT-12
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User runs `/mos:vault import --path ~/my-vault` and gets a complete Data Room with classified artifacts in the correct sections, ROOM.md at every level, STATE.md + MINTO.md per section
  2. Content classifier correctly routes notes to room sections based on content analysis (problem keywords -> problem-definition, financial data -> financial-model, etc.) with confidence scores
  3. Person names detected and team/ profiles auto-generated with wikilinked contribution tables. Meeting notes detected by date/attendee patterns and filed to meetings/
  4. Classification report generated showing where each note landed, confidence, and unclassified notes in inbox/ for manual routing
  5. After import, `/mos:status`, `/mos:grade`, `/mos:diagnose` and all other commands work immediately on the imported room
  6. Works on any folder of .md files -- Obsidian-specific features (wikilinks, frontmatter, .obsidian/) are bonuses, not requirements
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 81: Feynman-MINTO Hybrid (REVISION 2)
**Goal**: Every MINTO.md is born compressed via Feynman reasoning. /mos:reason is a slash command orchestrator: Claude (the host session) reads the prompt, runs Feynman stages 1/2/4/5 natively in its own context, and hands structured narrative JSON to a deterministic CJS helper that merges narrative with structural parts and writes the final MINTO.md. Zero external API calls, zero ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, zero per-run cost budget - the cost is whatever the user's existing Claude session already costs. Tier-0 fallback (pre-81 deterministic MINTO + AAAK footer) activates only when the generator is invoked from a bare shell or cron with no Claude in the loop. Ships as v1.10.2 (semver deviation from user directive, documented in CHANGELOG).
**Depends on**: Phase 80 (vault-section-minto-generator.cjs is the generator being split into plan and write subcommands) + committed AAAK library at lib/memory/aaak-compress.cjs (tier-0 fallback primitive, 21/21 tests green, not modified)
**Requirements**: FEYNMINTO-01, FEYNMINTO-02, FEYNMINTO-03, FEYNMINTO-04, FEYNMINTO-07, FEYNMINTO-08, FEYNMINTO-09, FEYNMINTO-10 (FEYNMINTO-05 and FEYNMINTO-06 retired, no meter)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. /mos:reason produces MINTO files under 1500 tokens when narrative JSON is provided (FEYNMINTO-01)
  2. Structural parts of MINTO (frontmatter, MECE tree, cross-refs, sources, navigation) remain deterministic and free, produced by the --plan and --write subcommands of vault-section-minto-generator.cjs with zero external calls (FEYNMINTO-02)
  3. commands/mos-reason.md is a slash command orchestrator that tells Claude to run Feynman stages 1/2/4/5 in-session and produce narrative JSON conforming to the R-3 schema (FEYNMINTO-03)
  4. Stages 3 (expose confusion) and 6 (teach it back) are intentionally skipped in automated generation because they require human review gates
  5. Tier-0 fallback activates when vault-section-minto-generator.cjs is invoked without a --narrative flag (no Claude session in the loop), producing deterministic MINTO plus AAAK footer (FEYNMINTO-04, FEYNMINTO-08)
  6. lib/memory/feynman-prompts.cjs holds the four Feynman stage prompts as string constants, the single source of truth for both the slash command orchestrator and the future v3.0 MCP Sampling tool (FEYNMINTO-09)
  7. /mos:reason --regenerate-all migrates pre-81 MINTOs to post-81 format with a backup to .migration-backup/YYYY-MM-DD/ first, and emits a report of old-size vs new-size and tier used per section (FEYNMINTO-07)
  8. Slash command orchestrator works natively on CLI, Desktop, and Cowork because all three run slash commands in the same Claude session model; no llm-call.cjs, no API key, no surface-specific code (FEYNMINTO-10)
  9. Pre-81 deterministic MINTO generator code path is preserved byte-equivalent as tier-0 fallback, validated by a frozen expected-tier0-baseline.md snapshot regression test
  10. CHANGELOG [1.10.2] entry documents: why v1.10.1 was skipped, slash-command-as-orchestrator architecture, why there is no API key or cost budget (Claude IS the LLM), migration path, the semver deviation, and a forward pointer to v3.0 MCP Sampling for headless tool invocations
**Plans**: 4 plans expected (81-01 foundation with plan/write subcommands + prompts + schema, 81-02 slash command orchestrator + fixture narratives, 81-03 generator rewrite + tier-0 fallback, 81-04 migration + release)
**Authority**: .planning/phases/81-feynman-minto-hybrid/81-CONTEXT.md (REVISION 2 at top supersedes Revision 1; Revision 1 preserved in _superseded/ subfolder for historical trace of the architectural mistake that was caught 2026-04-14)
