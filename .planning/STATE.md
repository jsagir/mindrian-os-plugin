# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Convert uncertainty to manageable risk -- every framework interaction produces bankable opportunities, every session starts with persona-aware routing
**Current focus:** Phase 71 - Opportunity Extraction Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Phase 71: Opportunity Extraction Engine)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-09

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: --
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

| Phase 71 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 71 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 72 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

### Decisions

- v1.9.3: APPROVE/REJECT/DEFER cascade, mid-session intelligence, filing completeness all shipped
- v1.9.4: Three-layer dependency order: OPP (engine) -> CONV (entry) -> ONBD (teaching)
- v1.9.4: 5 phases for 15 requirements -- OPP splits into engine+graph, CONV splits into routing+capture
- [Phase 71]: djb2 hash for opportunity dedup - fast, deterministic, sufficient for file-level uniqueness
- [Phase 71]: Knight position classification: gaps=uncertainty, convergences=risk, contradictions=mixed
- [Phase 71]: Hoist analyzeOutput before Step 10 try block for Step 11 cross-step reuse
- [Phase 72]: Non-blocking graph indexing: bankOpportunity writes file first, indexOpportunity fires as catch-swallowed promise
- [Phase 72]: ADDRESSES edges limited to 5 artifacts per domain section, IN_DOMAIN links to Section node

### Pending Todos

- generate-hub.cjs standard features (sticky top bar, persona card, vis-network graph)
- Update generate-snapshot.cjs constellation (sidebar/detail panel from Tony prototype)
- LaTeX export command: /mos:latex
- Desktop Data Room MCP: KuzuDB Windows build blocked
- Grading calibration data: 0/100+ Example nodes

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
