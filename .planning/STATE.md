# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Convert uncertainty to manageable risk -- every framework interaction produces bankable opportunities, every session starts with persona-aware routing
**Current focus:** Phase 80 — vault-import-obsidian-to-data-room

## Current Position

Phase: 80 (vault-import-obsidian-to-data-room) — EXECUTING
Plan: 5 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-13

### Decisions

- v1.9.3: APPROVE/REJECT/DEFER cascade, mid-session intelligence, filing completeness all shipped
- v1.9.4: Three-layer dependency order: OPP (engine) -> CONV (entry) -> ONBD (teaching)
- v1.9.4: 5 phases for 15 requirements -- OPP splits into engine+graph, CONV splits into routing+capture
- [Phase 71]: djb2 hash for opportunity dedup - fast, deterministic, sufficient for file-level uniqueness
- [Phase 71]: Knight position classification: gaps=uncertainty, convergences=risk, contradictions=mixed
- [Phase 71]: Hoist analyzeOutput before Step 10 try block for Step 11 cross-step reuse
- [Phase 72]: Non-blocking graph indexing: bankOpportunity writes file first, indexOpportunity fires as catch-swallowed promise
- [Phase 72]: ADDRESSES edges limited to 5 artifacts per domain section, IN_DOMAIN links to Section node
- [Phase 72]: Brain enrichment is non-blocking fire-and-forget in bankOpportunity
- [Phase 72]: FEEDS_INTO chains provide ordered validation step sequences for banked opportunities
- [Phase 73]: Inline Tier 0 chains in getTier0Chain() rather than parsing persona-chains.md at runtime
- [Phase 73]: Unknown persona defaults to researcher chain (problem-first is safest generic path)
- [Phase 73]: Tier 0 hardcoded framework chains for persona-based conversation routing without Brain dependency
- [Phase 74]: Atomic writes (.tmp then rename) for scratchpad crash safety
- [Phase 74]: Lazy require of opportunity-ops in migrateToRoom to avoid circular deps
- [Phase 74]: bank-opportunity auto-detects JSON vs roomDir+JSON argument pattern
- [Phase 74]: Scratchpad reading in session-start is non-blocking with || echo fallback
- [Phase 74]: Section seeding maps opportunity domain to room sections (problem-definition, solution-design, market-analysis, business-model)
- [Phase 75]: OPP_BANK_SUMMARY computed via inline node, sorted by confidence, injected into all three tiers
- [Phase 75-onboarding-redesign]: Mode-first onboarding: teach three ways to work before asking who the user is
- [Phase 75-onboarding-redesign]: Knight framing is practical with persona examples, not academic theory
- [Phase 79]: analyze-room reinterpretation: wikilink xref source files (no on-disk xref files exist)
- [Phase 80]: [Phase 80-01] MANIFEST schema_version 1.0 locked; writeManifest refuses any manifest without it
- [Phase 80]: [Phase 80-01] run-all-tests spawns each test file as child process to isolate assert failures
- [Phase 80]: [Phase 80-01] bin/mindrian-tools.cjs broken via better-sqlite3/lazygraph-ops chain; 80-05 must route /mos:vault import directly through scripts/vault-import.cjs
- [Phase 80]: Role re-inference in orchestrator covers person-detector narrow-window limitation (Jane Doe co-founder case)
- [Phase 80]: Stage 03c defaults to direct-copy meeting filing fallback per PRECONDITIONS.md (lazygraph-ops broken)

### Pending Todos

- generate-hub.cjs standard features (sticky top bar, persona card, vis-network graph)
- Update generate-snapshot.cjs constellation (sidebar/detail panel from Tony prototype)
- LaTeX export command: /mos:latex
- Desktop Data Room MCP: KuzuDB Windows build blocked
- Grading calibration data: 0/100+ Example nodes

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
